Jeremiah’s bank now offers a service that provides a tab separated output of each week’s bank statement automatically. Jeremiah would like to do some rudimentary investigations on his weekly spending and has asked you to do this in C# since he’s a real language purist and gets weird about these sorts of things.
He’s provided the output in the file: qbank-export-1-11-2020.txt
You can use any C# compiler and packages you wish to use for these task, but any nuget imports that Jeremiah has to install should be clearly indicated.
Jeremiah typically uses Microsoft Visual Studio 2016 and .NET Framework v4.7.x or above.
Console input and output is fine for all tasks, no front end is expected.
A sample structure and output for the program can be found on the next page.


<H2>TASK 1</H2>
Read the input data into your program from the output file and map the data into a class of your design. 
Reading ahead and seeing what other tasks you’ll need to perform may help influence your class design. 
Jeremiah will be running these operations once weekly, by loading the files in.

<H2>TASK 2</H2>
Jeremiah thinks that he may have been charged twice for coffee on the 29th of October.
